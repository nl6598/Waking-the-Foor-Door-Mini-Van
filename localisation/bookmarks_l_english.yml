 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Rising Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 ""The Golden Hawks Brigade was formed during the 1920's under the Italian leader Gregary Grant. Through this alliance, nations around the world are able to express their musicality through the use of instruments and vocal chords. Two nations emerged as the most talented through this alliance: Germany and Poland. Germany and Poland grew a strong diplomatic bond over the years and forgot about the tragedies of the Great War that loomed so long ago. All would change when Gregary Grant would make a sudden hostile move...""
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 WSC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Great War, many right-wing Canadians felt betrayed about the outcomes of the Treaty of Versailles. Years of conflicting ideas and stubborn bitterness would reach to the point of civil war, where the nationalists have been driven to the depths of Alaska known as the Great trek. Although the coalition survives to this day, weak morale and disorganization may led to the end of the newly formed nation. Burdens will not destroy the coalition, Adrian claims. The goal of the coalition: to unite Northern America under the leadership of the Warstarian Coalition." 
 NTD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great Depression Had crippled the already war torn country France. The French economy plummeted during the roaring twenties, which would be one of the many first events to occur of the splitting of France. At first called the Fighting Irish, these non aligned supporters pushed for heavy religious involvement within the French government. Overwhelming support began to divide the nation until the southern French states seceded. A new era of religious revival has begun in Europe, but will the ring of the Notre Dame Fight Song be enough to hold the forces of Islam rising in the east?"
 SOM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ethiopia and Liberia would not be the only independent african nations of the century. Abandoned by the Italians, the state of Somalia would come to be as the worlds third independent African country. Poverty and famine spread about the lands however, a strong leader was needed to improve the country. The Democratic Peoples Republic of Somalia would be founded, but can communism truly save this newly-born nation?"
 SER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Serbia emerged as one of the victors of the Great War, but at a cost of the millions that have perished. Like many other nations, the people of Serbia are too afraid to send another generation to die on the fields. Serbian nationalism is on the rise though: in the middle east, the looming terror of Islam begins to grow and bring fear to the people of the west. Serbia had chased the Ottomans out of the Balkans in 1910, but can the Serbians take on the forces of Arabia?"
 EOA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the west, great german ambitions of european domination grew as did in the east. Opressed by the once Ottoman state and soon afterwards the British Empire. The Sauds would reclaim their sacred homeland through the strategic use of calvary. United under Allah, Ibn Saud had gained much territory in the middle east. The Great Depression caused Britain and France to cede some territories: making Saudi Arabia an empire. Now that Sultan Saud has gained much power, vengeance will be pledged. The sun in the middle east is rising..."
 NCH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Japanese occupation of Manchuria and lower Mongolia had left a scar among the Chinese people. Many decades of European domination upon the continent had also been much of an embarrassment to the once superior Chinese. However, a new china is on the horizon. Revolving around right-wing policies, a new nationalist china has begun to dominate the lands of the Chinese. Generalissimo Ke Wei has since been in power incorporating European ideas to reform the country. Japanese and Chinese tensions have risen significantly in the new era of warfare. Ke wei and his nationalists are determined to reclaim Manchuria and reclaim what was once theirs from the foreign devils."
 INC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hidden beyond the Andean mountains, the Peruvians also had great ambitions. Its once great Incan Empire was truly the height of the peoples nationality, and many today dream of such a unity. The country and its current leader face huge corruption and scandalous problems. Many Peruvians wished to leave a memorable, historical legacy behind. Mussolini's dreams of a new Roman Empire have caught many attentions of the Peruvians. Finally after years of demanding protest, the once extinct empire was suddenly alive. What lies now for the new Empire? Will the Inca lay claim to their once territories? Or will they suffer the same fate they did centuries ago?"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 ZUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Zulu's had been one of the greatest warriors of the entire continent of Africa. Being occupied by the British did not break the morale or the spirits of the Zulu people. Fate came when the independence of the South African Republic came. The new Zulu nation, led by Cetshawyo the Second, broke away from the Republic and established the independent Zululandia. What ambitions do the Zulus have now? Will they take revenge on their previous masters? Or will they work to become of the greatest industrial powers in the world?"
 MXC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great Split of the 1920's brought great disaster among the nation of Mexico. What began as a mere revolution merged into a disaster as many provinces of Mexico began to break away. While Mexico would be subjected to many years of Martial Law and political chaos, new ideologies have begun to emerge within the heart of Mexico. Will Mexico ever be reunited into one nation? Which nation shall be the true Mexico?" 
 MPU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The effects of the Great Split had become so disasterous, that nations around the world began to provide foreign aid and assistance. The United States of America sought to re-unify Mexico and end the turmoil it was plunged in. Military action and campaign showed success, as Northern Mexico was secured. To this day, Northern Mexico remains occupied under American forces, destined to reunify the Mexican states. Will the Americans succeed in unification of the Mexican states?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The age of warfare had drastically changed. Trenches from the Great War are mere obsolete: the new age of mechanical warfare is on the brink. Some military sciencists have come to conclusion that the motorized and mechanized infantries of the world will be the most superior. A question remains: which nation will be the first to claim such a prize? Which nation will wake the four door mini van? 
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 MXC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters.

 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchionist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."

 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander combined with growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."

 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the revolution that deposed the last of the Qing Emperors, the young Chinese Republic has struggled to survive. Warlords rule much of the land on the periphery. In the heart of the country, the Communists have set up a base area in a remote mountain valley. Just beyond the borders, the Japanese have created a puppet government under the last Chinese Emperor and will try to reunite the country under his rule.\n\nWith many enemies threatening it, the government of Chiang Kai-Shek will have to make hard choices if it wants to survive and rule supreme in China."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After two years of war against the Japanese, the armies of Chiang Kai-Shek have bled themselves white trying to stop the assault. The enemy has overrun the richest areas of the country. Little support has been forthcoming from the western democracies, and the Communist seem unwilling to engage the enemy in open battle.\n\nWith the war threatening to spread even further, it appears that the worst is still to come. But as the Japanese attack is slowed by the vastness of the country, they may well turn their gaze in other directions, and new alliances may yet turn the tide..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Faced with an all-out Japanese attack, the Nationalists and Communists have struck an uneasy truce. Both sides are well aware that this United Front can not last. The Communist base area in Yan'an now forms the front line in the war against the Japanese.\n\nThe Communists must husband their resources carefully if they want to survive. Any casualties suffered in the fight against Japan will be felt twice over when the time comes to fight the war against the Nationalists, and this may well be what the government of Chiang Kai-Shek is counting on..."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."

 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government. \n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."
 WARLORDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The war with Japan has forced the Chinese Warlords to pick a side. But there can be no doubt that this alliance is living on borrowed time. The day will come when it has outlived its usefullness, and on that day the game is once again open for every man ambitious and ruthless enough to make a play for the title of Ruler of China."
